            <p>
                I am currently a computer science student pursuing my undergraduate degree at Pace University. 
                My interest for computer science stems from the creative possibilities that computer applications have to offer. 
                I am very interested in learning more about how software can create more opportunities for users to be more creative and productive. 
                I love learning how to utilize and how to create software that allows for the maximum use of imaginative minds. 
                I am currently looking for an internship for summer 2020.

                                We were inspired to create a 3D Statue Puzzle game because we wanted to implement photogrammetry into our game. The models of the used statue were imported into blender and split into pieces. 
                                In this Unity game, the player controls the rotation of the camera using the “a” and “d” keys. The player can also access an image of the completed statue using the “m” key.  The goal is to drag pieces of a broken statue back together through three levels. This game was created for Global Game Jam 2020.

                                We were inspired to create a Visual Novel because we wanted to parody the common tropes of other visual novel games. This game was developed in a game engine called Ren’Py. The game engine allowed us to work with 2D animation and UI elements to let us create a Visual Novel that allowed for branching paths for different endings. This game was created for BrickHack V.
